#Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Motivation: 
Last year my friend got shifted to US. From her I got to hear a lot on excitement of black friday sale around christmas. Just got curious to analyse the amount of benefitts it would impose both for sellers and buyers, hence thought of exploring this data which I came across in kaggle.
